# my-website-in-HTML
This website will contain information about myself, who I am, what I know, what I've worked on. It will be developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. 

As of right now, the coding looks very messy but what I plan in the future is to make it more concise and more readable by reducing lines of code.
